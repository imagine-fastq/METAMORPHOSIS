### 🔬 Abstract
**METAMORPHOSIS** is an experimental **Audio-Visual Glitch Art** project that treats video data not as a static file, but as a biological organism capable of mutation and evolution.

From a Bioinformatician's perspective; it aims to inject the chaotic order of DNA sequencing data (FASTQ) into the rigid structure of visual media (MP4). The project splits reality into **Phenotype (Vision)** and **Genotype (Data)**, resynthesizing them through procedural **Sonification**.

### 🧠 Concept: `imagine-fastq`
This project stands at the intersection of Genomic Data Science (Dry-lab) and Digital Art. The nomenclature and structure rest on three pillars:
1.  **Imagine:** A utopia where boundaries dissolve and data becomes free (Lennon).
2.  **FASTQ:** The raw format of biological data. Here, we reduce pixels to `0` and `1` bases instead of `ACGT`.
3.  **Metamorphosis:** The Kafkaesque process where the image becomes unrecognizable, transforming into a new form (Noise/Glitch).

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture
The system operates like a Python-based modular **VJ Mixer**. While analyzing the video frame-by-frame, it simultaneously performs **Procedural Sound Synthesis (DSP)**.
* **Organic State:** 40Hz Deep Abyss Drone (LFO Modulated).
* **Skeletal State:** 60Hz Cardiac Pulse (Biological Rhythm).
* **Digital State:** High-frequency Sonar Pings (Data Flow).
